# This workflow will be triggered in two ways:
on:
  # 1. Manually, with a "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

  # 2. Automatically, when the "CI - Build and Push" workflow finishes

    workflows: ["CI - Build and Push Docker Images"] # Name of your other file
    types:
      - completed # Run only when it's 'completed'
